<p><strong>March 23, 2005:</strong> There is now a <a href="http://greaseblog.blogspot.com/">Greasemonkey blog</a>, for up to the minute updates on all matters Greasemonkey.</p>

<!-- MAIN CONTENT -->
<p>Greasemonkey is a Firefox extension which lets you to add bits of DHTML ("user scripts") to any webpage to change its behavior. In much the same way that <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/unix/customizing.html#usercss">user CSS</a> lets you take control of a webpage's style, user scripts let you easily control any aspect of a webpage's design or interaction.</p>

<p>For example you could:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://downloads.mozdev.org/greasemonkey/linkify.user.js">Make sure that all URLs displayed in the browser are clickable links</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://downloads.mozdev.org/greasemonkey/allmusic.user.js">Improve the usability of a site you frequent</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://downloads.mozdev.org/greasemonkey/popup-fixer.user.js">Route around common and annoying website bugs</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://downloads.mozdev.org/greasemonkey/coralize.user.js">Use the <a href="http://coralcdn.org">Coral content network</a> selectively.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A pretty comprehensive collection of known scripts is maintained at the <a href="http://dunck.us/collab/GreaseMonkeyUserScripts">Greasemonkey Script Repository</a>.</p>

<p>Greasemonkey was heavily inspired by Adrian Holovaty's <a href="http://holovaty.com/blog/archive/2004/07/19/2210">site-specific extension for All Music Guide</a> and the conversation which ensued after he published it. There were tons of sites I wanted to create SSE's for, but fully-fledged firefox extensions proved too cumbersome. I wanted it to be as easy to create an SSE as it is to write DHTML.</p>

<p>Originally conceived by <a href="http://stilleye.com/">David Schontzler</a> and <a href="http://youngpup.net/">Aaron Boodman</a> late one night while both should have been sleeping. Aaron implemented it over the next few weeks in the break between employment with <a href="http://youngpup.net/2004/microsoft">Microsoft</a> and <a href="http://youngpup.net/2004/1108055444">Google</a>. Neither company is associated with Greasemonkey in any way.</p>

<p>The current maintainers are Aaron Boodman and <a href="http://dunck.us/anabasis/">Jeremy Dunck</a> with the invaluable help of an <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/list.html">awesome</a> <a href="http://dunck.us/collab/GreaseMonkeyUserScripts">community</a> of user script enthusiasts.</p>
