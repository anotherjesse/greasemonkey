<!-- MAIN CONTENT -->
<p>Grease Monkey is a Firefox extension which lets you to add bits of DHTML ("user scripts") to any webpage to change it's behavior. In much the same way that <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/unix/customizing.html#usercss">user CSS</a> lets you take control of a webpage's style, user scripts let you easily control any aspect of a webpage's design or interaction.</p>

<p>For example you could:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://downloads.mozdev.org/greasemonkey/linkify.user.js">Make sure that all URLs displayed in the browser are clickable links</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://downloads.mozdev.org/greasemonkey/allmusic.user.js">Improve the usability of a site you frequent</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://downloads.mozdev.org/greasemonkey/popup-fixer.js">Route around common and annoying website bugs</a></li>
</ul>

<!--<p>Here are <a href="scripts">some other scripts</a> I've written or been made aware of. However, it's probably best to consult Google for a complete and current list.</p>-->

<p>Grease Monkey was heavily inspired by Adrian Holovaty's <a href="http://holovaty.com/blog/archive/2004/07/19/2210">site-specific extension for All Music Guide</a> and the conversation which ensued after he published it. There were tons of sites I wanted to create SSE's for, but fully-fledged firefox extensions proved too cumbersome. I wanted it to be as easy to create an SSE as it is to write DHTML.</p>

<p>Also muchos gustos to <a href="http://stilleye.com/">David Schontzler</a> who helped with the original idea as well as later refinements.</p>
