<h4 id="xpcnativewrappers">XPCNative What?</h4>

<p>An ongoing problem with user scripting is that the website being scripted 
can redefine common JavaScript methods so that they don't work the way the 
script expects them too.</p>

<p>For example, let's say a website developer redefines 
<code>document.getElementById</code> so that it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>document.getElementById = function(id) {}</code></pre>

<p>A script running on a webpage could use method redefinition to block 
individual user scripts. They could also use it to sniff the source code of 
user scripts, or even, in certain extreme cases, gain access to GM_* APIs.</p> 

<p>Method redefinition is bad news for user scripters.</p>

<p>The next version of Firefox ("Deer Park") deals a pretty big blow to 
method redefinition via the new <a 
href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XPCNativeWrapper">deep 
XPCNativeWrapper</a> object. When you wrap a DOM object in a deep 
XPCNativeWrapper and call methods on it, you are guaranteed that those methods 
will be the original ones defined for that type of object. It's impossible to 
accidentally get a redefined method instead.</p>

<p>Additionally, any DOM objects which get returned by any of a deep 
XPCNativeWrapper's methods or properties will also be a deep XPCNativeWrapper 
(hence the "deep" bit)</p>

<p>In Greasemonkey 0.5, when running on Deer Park, the <code>window</code> and
<code>document</code> global variables are deep XPCNativeWrappers. For the 
most part, this transparently improves security for user scripts. But as with
any new, developing technology, there are some limitations. Keep up with 
<a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XPCNativeWrapper">all the 
latest XPCNativeWrapper wackiness</a> on the developer.mozilla.org page.</p>
