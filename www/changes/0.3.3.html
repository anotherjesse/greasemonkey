<p><em><strong>Warning:</strong> Beta versions have not been fully tested. For best results, always install the latest stable version from the <a href="/">homepage</a>.</em></p>

<h4>Changes (since <a href="0.3b.html">0.2.6</a>)</h4>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://bugzilla.mozdev.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10106">Bug 10106: Updates</a> for FF 1.0.4 support. </li>
  <li><a href="http://bugzilla.mozdev.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10185">Bug 10185: Tweaked GM_registerMenuCommand</a> so that user script function doesn't get the chrome event.  commandFunc now takes no parameters.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Have not yet implemented clean uninstall. This means that if you downgrade to an earlier version you may have to clean out your preferences and config folder by hand.</li>
  <li>Although FF 1.0.3 is now supported, that browser breaks some existing scripts because it removed the undocumented, unsupport window._content property. No scripts should have been using this in the first place as it was a circular reference back to window. Affected scripts will have to be modified.</li>
</ul>
