<h3><a href="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/extensions/greasemonkey/greasemonkey-0.3.5-fx.xpi">Install Greasemonkey 0.3.5</a> - Stable</h3>

<p>This is a security hotfix to 0.3.3. See <a href="http://greaseblog.blogspot.com/2005/07/mandatory-greasemonkey-update.html">Greaseblog post</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Note that this Greasemonkey disables all GM* APIs, which means that it will break many user scripts. This is a temporary measure for people who want to continue using Greasemonkey without those features. A future version will re-enable the APIs.</p>
